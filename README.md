# OpenCV Headshot Tracking with Arduino

An interactive computer vision game that combines real-time face tracking, hand gesture recognition, and Arduino-controlled laser positioning for an immersive gaming experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project implements a finger counting game using advanced computer vision techniques where players must:
- Navigate their face to find hidden safe zones while being tracked by a laser pointer
- Answer mathematical equations by showing the correct number of fingers
- Complete challenges within a 60-second time limit

The system integrates OpenCV face detection, MediaPipe hand tracking, and Arduino servo control to create a unique interactive experience that bridges digital computer vision with physical hardware control.
