# OpenCV Headshot Tracking with Arduino

An interactive computer vision game that combines real-time face tracking, hand gesture recognition, and Arduino-controlled laser positioning for an immersive gaming experience.

## Project Overview

This project implements a finger counting game using advanced computer vision techniques where players must:
- Navigate their face to find hidden safe zones while being tracked by a laser pointer
- Answer mathematical equations by showing the correct number of fingers
- Complete challenges within a 60-second time limit

The system integrates OpenCV face detection, MediaPipe hand tracking, and Arduino servo control to create a unique interactive experience that bridges digital computer vision with physical hardware control.

## Hardware Components

### Required Equipment
| Component | Quantity | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Micro Servo SG90 (180°)** | 4x | X/Y axis laser positioning control |
| **2-DoF Robot Arm Platform Frame** | 2x | Mechanical mounting for servos |
| **Arduino UNO R3** | 2x | Microcontroller for servo control |
| **Proto Screw Shield v1.0** | 2x | Arduino connection interface |
| **10K Potentiometer** | 2x | Laser intensity control for safety |
| **Laser Pointer Module** | 2x | Visual tracking indicator |

### Hardware Setup
The system uses a pan-tilt mechanism controlled by two servo motors:
- **X-axis servo**: Controls horizontal laser movement (0-180°)
- **Y-axis servo**: Controls vertical laser movement (0-180°)
- **Safety feature**: 10K potentiometer reduces laser intensity for eye protection
